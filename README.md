### Project Overview
As a data visualization specialist for a nonprofit that provides data driven storytelling on disasters around the world, your goal for the project is to visusally show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. 

### Challenge Objectives
Update the earthquake map you have already written so that it includes: 
- three different background map options
- an earthquake overlay with all earthquakes in the last 7 days,
- a separate earthquake overlay highlighting earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 4.5, and
- a final overlay that displays the location of tectonic plates.
